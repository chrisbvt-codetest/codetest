Unfortunately I wasn't too familiar with creating a servlet in Java so this ended up taking me a bit and I've run out of time. A few things I'd probably change here is how we're doing pathing for the API as there's probably a way to do that in the web.xml file (this seemed to be breaking also at this point). If you'd like to check out something similar I've done in Python check out: https://www.github.com/chrisbvt/ML-MalwareDetection/tree/master/Servers/BackendAPI

Definitely have to brush up on my Java a bit more in the future!
