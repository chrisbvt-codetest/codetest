Unfortunately I wasn't too familiar with creating a servlet in Java so this ended up taking me a bit and I've run out of time. If you'd like to check out something similar I've done in Python check out: https://www.github.com/chrisbvt/ML-MalwareDetection/tree/master/Servers/BackendAPI

Definitely have to brush up on my Java a bit more in the future!
